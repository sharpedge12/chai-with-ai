**Topic:** ai-tool
**Target Audience:** entrepreneur/developer

> I’ve been thinking a lot about AI storytelling tools lately, and something keeps bothering me. Most of them generate content, but nothing really persists. You get a story, you read it, and then it disappears. The next one has no memory of what came before. So I decided to run a small experiment.

**Why it matters:**
> This experiment showcases a novel approach to AI storytelling tools, focusing on persistence and memory rather than generating isolated content. This could inspire others to think outside the box when it comes to AI applications.
