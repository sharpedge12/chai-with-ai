      "description": "Been reading through \"Masked Depth Modeling for Spatial Perception\" from Ant Group and the core idea clicked for me. RGB-D cameras fail on reflective and transparent surfaces, and most methods just discard these missing values as noise. This paper does the opposite: sensor failures happen exactly...",
