**Score:** 0.83 | **Source:** reddit | **Engagement:** 8.0

**Idea Type:** concept

Been reading through "Masked Depth Modeling for Spatial Perception" from Ant Group and the core idea clicked for me. RGB-D cameras fail on reflective and transparent surfaces, and most methods just discard these missing values as noise. This paper does the opposite: sensor failures happen exactly...

**Why it matters:** The idea scores high on innovation level (0.95) as it challenges the conventional approach of discarding missing values in RGB-D cameras. The market p...

**Idea Type:** concept

I recently published a blog where I go beyond theory and implement OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect end to end, from scratch, without using any auth-specific frameworks. This is part of an authentication-focused series I’m working on. There was a short hiatus of around 2–3 months (longer than I had...

**Why it matters:** The innovation level is high due to the novel approach of building an authentication system without using any auth-specific frameworks. The market pot...

## 5. [Nanbeige4-3B-Thinking-2511 is great for summarization](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1qnltu7/nanbeige43bthinking2511_is_great_for_summarization/)

**Score:** 0.63 | **Source:** reddit | **Engagement:** 4.0

**Idea Type:** concept

Sometimes I dont want to watch a 30 minute youtube video on some drama or tech news, but just feeding the transcript into this model works so well. I use a character card thats just telling it thats its for summarization so I can be lazy and not tell it what I want it to do every time.

**Why it matters:** The innovation level is moderate (0.63) as the approach is not entirely new but still showcases some novelty. Market potential is decent (0.75), as it...
